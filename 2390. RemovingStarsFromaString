https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

Problem Summary: Find the length of the longest substring character in a given string S that does not contain any repeating
characters. A substring is a continuous sequence of characters within a string 

Brute-Force Approach:
1. Iterate through String S 
2. If Character is star and stack not empty pop the last element in stack
3. else add the element to the stack  
4. Return the stack 

Code in Py:
class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
     stack = []   #initialization of empty stack to keep track of characters 
     for char in s: #loop through the string
        if char == '*':   #if character is star and stack not empty pop element
            if stack:  
                stack.pop() 
        else: stack.append(char) #Otherwise add character to the stack

     return ''.join(stack)
